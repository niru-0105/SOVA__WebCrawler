Greetings from our SOVA team
We have made a small web crawler which will crawl home page of any given URL

To use this please follow given steps
1. Download zip folder of our code and extract it in a folder
1. If you don't have node.js installed on your computer please download it from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ here.
2. Open any terminal in your computer and move to the directory in which you have extracted zip folder.
3. Now run the command 'npm install' it will install required node modules in the existing folder.
4. Now run the command 'node index2.js "URL"'.
